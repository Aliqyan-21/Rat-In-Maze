## About

I was learning about the Rat in Maze problem on competitive coding platforms that is solved with recursion and backtracking.

Then I thought it would be fun if we could visualize it happening in front of our eyes.

That's why I wrote this program.

## What it Does

This program will help visualize the Rat In Maze problem just through command prompt and by live changes in matrix.

## Visualization

- This is the maze that the rat will traverse in this input

- Here is the video of the Rat in action!

## `main.cpp`

Contains the driver code and the input.

## `pathFinder.h`

Contains the functions :-

- `findPath()` - which have main code to find path with recursion and backtracking

- `isSafe()` - to check for 3 conditions to find out if that way to go is safe or not.

Do check code for more insight...

## Quickstart

Compile it

```bash
	gcc main.cpp -o main
```

Run it

```bash
	./main
```

### Note

- You can use this program to study about how backtracking works and how it is visually seen!

- You can use this code for your learning pupose or to teach someone about this problem.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜‹
